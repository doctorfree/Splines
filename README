This program uses bouncing balls as control points for generating
cubic curves. Two methods are used to calculate the curve. One, the
Bezier form for defining a cubic, uses n control points with
the tangent vectors at the endpoints being defined by the line
segments between control points. The other, referred to as the
B-spline cubic representation, doesn't pass thru any control points.
In the B-spline, the points where the curve "joins" and their derivatives
are weighted sums of the three immediately adjacent control points.

From "Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics" by Foley and Van Dam :
"This terminology traces back to the long flexible strips of metal, 
called splines, used by draftsmen to lay out the surfaces of airplanes 
and ships. The metal splines, unless severely stressed, also have second-order
continuity."

From "Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics" by Newman and Sproull :
"P. Bezier, of the French firm Regie Renault, pioneered the use of computer
modeling of surfaces in automobile design. His UNISURF system, used by
designers since 1972, has been applied to define the outer panels of several
cars marketed by Renault."
